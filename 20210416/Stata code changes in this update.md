* Stata code changes in this update

- Code for IHME bypasses Operating Command determination by using -cd- change directory.

- Identification of peak dates and values are retired.

- Do Farsi graphs are retired. 

  Selected English graphs do show Hijri dates, e.g., 21-05-22 shows "Kho" net to 21-05-22, "Kho" being short for month "Khordad" (1st), i.e. 1400-03-01.
