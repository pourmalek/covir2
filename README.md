### Statement on COVID-19 vaccination in Islamic Republic of Iran by WHO Representative Dr Jaffar Hussain

Tehran, 19 August 2021 – WHO expresses concern over the COVID-19 outbreak in Islamic Republic of Iran, and its impact on the lives, well-being, and livelihoods of the Iranian people. The Organization remains committed to working with all partners to saves lives, ensure well-being, and control infection across the country. 

As COVID-19 continues to hit the country aggressively, the level of vaccination coverage is low. As of 16 August 2021, 13.1% of the total population have received a first dose and 5.15% have received 2 doses. While delays in delivering sufficient doses of COVID-19 vaccines have limited the capacity to increase coverage, it is encouraging to see an acceleration that started in early August 2021 to vaccinate priority groups and people in the age groups of 40s and 30s in the worst hit provinces of Islamic Republic of Iran.

To date, the COVAX Facility has delivered a total of 5 064 610 COVID-19 vaccines doses to Islamic Republic of Iran. An additional 8.5 million doses from the COVAX Facility will be delivered in August and September 2021. Vaccine donations from other countries are expected to arrive in the country on 20 August 2021.

As part of its ongoing response to the pandemic, WHO continues to mobilize teams to provide information, recommendations and technical guidance. WHO also continues to engage proactively with national counterparts to strengthen the health care system and raise awareness about the virus to counter its heavy economic and social burden. One key measure taken in Islamic Republic of Iran is the COVID-19 Emergency Response Project (ICERP), financed by The World Bank and in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. The project has delivered life-saving medical and diagnostic equipment to public hospitals and laboratories across the country to support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dr. Kourosh Holakouie Naeini, Professor of Epidemiology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences:
 
## Ministry of Health performs "**_engineering_**" of "data". [aka. data **_fabrication and falsification_**]

## The real number of deaths is **_seven times more than the official reports_**. 

The next peak of the epidemic in Iran will occurring about **_four months_**. 

The **_lambda_** variant will definitely come to Iran and will be more deadly than the previous variants.

There is no [actual] management of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran and the virus is left at large to spread. 

Some individuals benefit from this non-existence of epidemic management: the blackmarket of COVID-19 medications, **_conflict of interest_** in vaccine production and import, etc.

### Related repositories:

THREE “CovidVisualized” repositories, use a common template and logic for visualization of the results of estimates of FIVE international and periodically updated COVID-19 pandemic models for the future of the epidemic:

[`CovidVisualizedGlobal`]( https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal) for the [`GLOBAL`](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal#covidvisualizedglobal) level

[`CovidVisualizedCountry`](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry) for countries with subnational estimates: [`CANADA`](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry#covidvisualizedcountry)

[`covir2`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2) for countries without subnational estimates: [`IRAN`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2#covir2)

These results in these three repositories get periodically updated. 

The codes in these repositories can be adapted for use for any country or region in the world. 
 
* For a sample application of “covir2” to a country without subnational estimates see [`Afghanistan`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/ADAPTATIONS_EXAMPLES/Afghanistan_%2020210625/20210625/README.md) [`Pakistan`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/ADAPTATIONS_EXAMPLES/Pakistan_20210704)

**CovidVisualized: Visualized compilation of international updated models’ estimates of COVID-19 pandemic at global and country levels**

Farshad Pourmalek, MD PhD

<br/><br/>

 
**SUMMARY**

**Objectives**: To identify international and periodically updated models of the COVID-19 pandemic, compile and visualize their estimation results at the global and country levels, and periodically update the compilations. When one or more models predict an increase in daily cases or infections and deaths in the next one to three months, technical advisors to the national and subnational decision-makers can consider this early alarm for assessment and suggestion of augmentation of preventive measures and interventions. 

**Methods and Results**: Five international and periodically updated models of the COVID-19 pandemic were identified, created by: (1) Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, (2) Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Seattle, (3) Imperial College, London, (4) Los Alamos National Laboratories, Los Alamos, and (5) University of Southern California, Los Angeles. Estimates of these five identified models were gathered, combined, and graphed at global and two country levels. Canada and Iran were chosen as countries with and without subnational estimates, respectively. Compilations of results are periodically updated. Three Github repositories were created that contain the codes and results, i.e., “CovidVisualizedGlobal” for the global level, “CovidVisualizedCountry” for a country with subnational estimates – Canada, and “covir2” for a country without subnational estimates – Iran.

**Keywords**: COVID-19, pandemic, epidemic, models, visualization, global, Canada, Iran



<br/><br/>

**BACKGROUND**

**Objectives and rationale**: The objectives are to identify international and periodically updated models of the COVID-19 pandemic, compile and visualize their estimations’ results at the global and country levels, and periodically update the compilations. The ultimate objective is to provide an early warning system for technical advisors to the decision-makers. When the predictions of one or more models show an increase in daily cases or infections, hospitalizations, or deaths in the next one to three months, technical advisors to the national and subnational decision-makers may consider assessing the situation and suggesting augmentation of non-pharmacologic preventive interventions and vaccinations. In doing so, the strengths and weaknesses of individual models need to be considered and those of this work. Models’ estimates demonstrate the trajectory of COVID-19 deaths, cases or infections, and hospital-related outcomes in one to three months into the future.  



<br/><br/>

**METHODS**

**Eligibility criteria**: The criteria for inclusion of target COVID-19 pandemic models were (1) an international model scope and (2) periodic updates. “International model” denotes a model that estimates COVID-19 cases or infections and deaths for all countries of the world, with global-level estimates that equate the sum of the national-level estimates. “Periodically updated” denotes a model with a record of periodically updated estimates since its first release, with continued updates in 2021. 

**Finding the eligible models**: The eligible models were found within the literature search of a previous publication, “Rapid review of COVID-19 epidemic estimation studies for Iran” [1]. The results were verified by comparison with models found in a recently published study on “Predictive performance of international COVID-19 mortality forecasting models” [2]. While non-updated or one-time models can be contemporaneously usable, their results would not sustain up-to-dateness in the long run, especially with the emergence of new variants of concern and various degrees of uncertainties in the progression of vaccination coverage.

The COVID-19 pandemic model by Youyang Gu [9] and the model by University of California, Los Angeles model [10] could not be categorized as international and periodically updated models. The COVID-19 International Modelling Consortium (CoMo Consortium) model, created by researchers at the University of Oxford and Cornell University [11], and CovidSim (COVID Simulation) model, developed by researchers at Imperial College, London [12], provide templates for researchers to model the future of epidemic trajectory at national and subnational levels of their choice, through adjusting the model inputs and setting the time horizon into future for the estimations. Unlike the five international and periodically updated models mentioned above, the latter two models are not intended for periodic updates by their original creators. The CoMo Consortium has engaged some countries, including Iran, but not Canada. There is no evidence of either model being used on a periodically updated basis in Iran or Canada.

 
<br/><br/>
 
**(2) The CovidVisualized repositories created in this work**
 
GitHub (https://github.com) is used for sharing the codes and data. Global and country levels were chosen for demonstration of results. For the national level, one country with and one country without subnational estimates – Canada and Iran, respectively – were chosen based on personal bonds. 

Four of the five identified models share codes and estimates updates via GitHub repositories, and the IHME estimates are released on IHME’s website [4]. Three Github repositories were created for this project: “CovidVisualizedGlobal” [13] for the global level, “CovidVisualizedCountry” [14] for Canada, and “covir2” [15] for Iran. These are referred to as CovidVisualized GitHub repositories hereon. The “covir2” repository was created as “COVID Iran Review number 2” in March 2021, as an update after a first-iteration review was published [1]. The idea and work were further developed toward applicability to any location in the world, with case application for the global level, Canada, and Iran. 

GitHub repositories allow others to view and/or download, scrutinize, and verify the integrity of the codes and data. It is also possible to minimally modify the codes to recreate similar repositories for any other country that reports COVID-19 cases and deaths to World Health Organization. Such use of the codes and data in GitHub is free of charge and bound to the pertinent licenses.

**(3) Data management**

**[Data management template](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/Variable%20name%20structure.md)**: A data management template was created for assigning comparable variable names to various outcomes from different models. Comparable and common variable names consist of generic parts (positions in the variable name) denoting the following items: (1) daily or total, (2) deaths, cases or infections, or other outcomes, (3) mean estimate, or lower, or upper uncertainty limit, (4) raw or smoothed estimate, (5) each of the five individual models, and (6) scenarios within each model. This template is described in detail in [“variable name structure”](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/Variable%20name%20structure.md) in the CovidVisualized GitHub repositories [16]. Stata SE 14.2 (Stata Statistical Software. StataCorp. College Station, Texas) was used to write and run the codes on macOS Big Sur, and test run on Microsoft Windows 10. 

**Data management**: Data acquisition, management, and graphing were performed via Stata codes. Stata codes download the models’ output files from their respective websites, edit them according to the data management template, store each model’s estimates in a single file, and create graphs for all outcomes produced by each model. Then, the models’ single data files are compiled into a single final file, and graphs for all common outcomes are created for this compilation of all models. These graphs are shown on the pages of the three CovidVisualized GitHub repositories [13-15] and in periodical [Situation Reports](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/situation%20reports) created with each uptake. 
 
_Outcome types_: Besides (1) daily deaths, (2) daily incident cases or infections, (3) total deaths, and (4) total cases or infections, other outcomes estimated by one or more individual models include prevalence, active or prevalent cases, recovered cases, hospital admissions, regular beds needed, ICU (Intensive Care Unit) beds needed, ventilated cases, seroprevalence, and effective reproduction number. All outcome types were graphed. 

_Secondary variables_: Secondary variables are created in this work using the primary variables released by the individual models. They include case fatality rate (CFR), infection fatality rate (IFR), cases per deaths, ratio of estimated to reported deaths, and ratio of estimated to reported cases. CFR and IFR have only a daily version, and the other secondary variables have both daily and total (cumulative) versions. 

_Uncertainty, scenarios, variants, and vaccines_: For each model and for each outcome, both the point (mean) estimates and the interval estimates (95% uncertainty limits) were graphed where available. Similarly, both the “reference” scenario (aka status quo) and alternative scenarios (i.e., “better” and “worse” scenarios) were graphed for models with more than one scenario (i.e., IHME and IMPE). Assumptions about and empirical inputs from distributions of variants and vaccination coverages across space and time have been progressively included in models and scenarios of IHME and IMPE. 

_Subnational estimates_: The DELP and IHME models provide subnational-level estimates for countries reporting national and subnational level COVID-19 outcomes. Graphs were created for national and subnational-level locations (i.e., provinces in Canada) available in DELP and IHME model outputs. 
<br/><br/>
 
 
**(4) Periodical uptakes**

A [set of conventions](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/setup/README.md) were created for the periodic uptake of the models’ estimates updates. The two models with the least frequency of periodic updates of estimates are IHME and IMPE, updated almost weekly and bi-weekly, respectively. With the release of each update of either of these two models, the whole set of the five included models are updated in all the three CovidVisualized GitHub repositories. The most recent update of each model is used. These updates of CovidVisualized repositories are labelled as “uptakes” to differentiate them from models’ estimates updates. These [conventions for periodical uptakes](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/setup/README.md) are described in detail in the CovidVisualized GitHub repositories [17]. R software via RStudio 1.4 (Integrated Development for R. RStudio. PBC, Boston, Massachusetts) was used for semi-automatization of the uptakes’ execution. Estimates of the LANL model get updated about every 3-4 days, and DELP and SRIV models get updated daily. Uptaking the models’ estimates updates with every update of these latter three models is not expected to depict a much more informative profile of the epidemic’s trajectory in future, when compared against the current convention for uptakes. The IHME, IMPE, and SRIV models provide estimates for about three months into the future with each update release, the DELP model for about two months, and the LANL model for about one month.  

 
With each uptake, a directory is created in the root of the main branch of each of the three CovidVisualized repositories and named with the uptake date (e.g., 20210730). Uptakes are also created retrospectively, compiling the results of the previous updates of the models’ results. Available uptakes for Iran and the global level have been created going back to April 2021 and for Canada to June 2021. Under each dated uptake directory, there are two directories for “code” and for “output”. Under each, there are located directories with the abbreviated name of the models. For example, “DELP” directories under “code” store the Stata code files (.do), and those under “output” contain the outputs from executing the codes: the single data file for model estimates (in. dta and .csv formats), Stata log file (.smcl), and the graphs in PDF format. The directory “master” contains the master Stata do-file which executes all the other do-files, and the directory “merge” (under “code”) contains the code for creating the single final merged file of all models. The directory “merge” (under “output”) stores the created single final merged file of all compiled models, as well as the graphs that contain all the models. Selected graphs that contain all the models are visible on the root page of each uptake directory and are also stacked in reverse chronological order on the main page of each repository. With each uptake, selected graphs of estimated outcomes are added at the start of the main page for each repository. [Situation Reports](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/situation%20reports) are created and shared with national and subnational health authorities. 
 
 
Similar work: The [“covidcompare”](https://covidcompare.io) tool [18] provides graph visualization of the latest estimates of daily and total deaths from international and periodically updated COVID-19 pandemic models for countries of the world and US states, along with historical forecasts and model performance, based on IHME’s “Predictive performance of international COVID-19 mortality forecasting models” [2]. 

 <br/><br/>
 
**LIMITATIONS, STRENGTHS, AND FURTHER DIRECTIONS**
<br/><br/>
 
**Limitations**: Limitations of this work include the programming languages, automatization of uptakes, and choice of the website for presentation of the results. 
 
Stata programming language constitutes about 99% of the codes. Whereas Stata is a commercial software package, using non-commercial packages such as R and/or Python can increase the accessibility and adaptability of the codes for other researchers. Further use of R and/or Python can also make the uptakes almost fully automatized. Some health researchers may not be familiar with GitHub and GIT programming. Therefore, additional use of a dedicated website that is more visible to and accessible for the target audience can increase the reach and effect of this work. 
 
Strengths and weaknesses of individual international and periodically updated COVID-19 pandemic models are not mentioned here, but they have been discussed elsewhere [1-2].
<br/><br/>

**Strengths**: Strengths of this work include usability for informing technical advisors to the decision-makers, adaptability for use in other countries, and automatized data acquisition.
 
_Tested usability for informing technical advisors to the decision-makers at the country level_: Results of the GitHub repository “covir2” [15] were used to present the predictions of the five international and periodically updated models of COVID-19 pandemic about the possibility, timing, slope, height, and drivers of a potential fifth wave of the epidemic in Iran. This presentation was done using the results of the covir2 repository along with the results of an e-mail survey of more than 40 epidemiologists and public health specialists. The predictions and results were presented and described in a live online session for three Deputy Ministers of Health and six epidemiologists selected by Iran’s Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME). Periodical [situation reports](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/situation%20reports) based on each uptake are also shared with MOHME. 

_Adaptability of the codes for use in other countries or regions in the world_: The codes available in GitHub repositories “CovidVisualizedCountry” [14] and “covir2” [15] can be slightly modified by any researcher to be used for countries with and without subnational estimates respectively (See examples for [United States](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry/tree/main/ADAPTATIONS_EXAMPLES), [Afghanistan](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/ADAPTATIONS_EXAMPLES), and [Pakistan](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/ADAPTATIONS_EXAMPLES)). “CovidVisualizedCountry” can be adjusted for use for any type of regionalization of the countries of the world, e.g., World Health Organization regions. 

_Automatized data acquisition_: The Stata codes in these repositories automatically download the estimates’ data files from the five included models once executed. There is no additional need for users to locate, download, and edit the estimates’ data of individual models before running the codes. This automatic data acquisition further enhances computational reproducibility – “obtaining consistent results using the same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis” [19].
 <br/><br/>
 
**Further research**: Further directions include using the “ensemble” method to statistically combine models’ estimates, and retrospective assessment of models’ predictive performance. In ensemble methods, individual models are evaluated for minimum requirements of quality and reporting. They are statistically combined using specific relative weights for each model, where the weights reflect the comparative accuracy of each model. Such ensemble methods are used by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [20] and US COVID-19 Forecast Hub [21]. The ensemble models have been empirically shown to be more accurate than any of the individual models used in the ensemble method [22]. Retrospective assessment of models’ predictive performance includes using statistical and graphical methods to estimate and visualize the accuracy of models’ estimations [2].

## III. INNER WORKS OF THIS REPOSITORY 

The Stata _codes_ can be executed on local machines:

Run in Stata "Users/local-user-name/Downloads/covir2-main/20210709/code/master/do country master.do" on your local machine after the directory /covir2-main/ is downloaded into and is located in the root of /Downloads/ folder of your local machine, for uptake 20210709; and other instances of 202YMMDD for other uptake dates. 

Preproduced _outputs_ are stored for each uptake, e.g., [`20210709`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210709/), in folder [`output`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210709/output), for each component study, i.e., [`DELP`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210709/output/DELP), [`IHME`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210709/output/IHME), [`IMPE`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210709/output/IMPE), [`LANL`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210709/output/LANL), and [`SRIV`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210709/output/SRIV), plus [`JOHN`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210709/output/JOHN) as benchmark. Combined results are stored in [`merge`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210709/output/merge). All merged graphs for each uptake are accessible via main page of each uptake date, e.g., https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210709/ and the link is placed in front of **Merged graphs of uptake 20210709** [here]( https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/20210709/graphs%20merged%2020210709.pdf)

[`Variable name structure`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/Variable%20name%20structure.md) describes the template for models’ output data management used in this repository. 


[`Rule for uptakes`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/setup/README.md)  describes the rule for periodical uptakes used in this repository. 
 

[`Troubleshooting`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md) describes possible difficulties in running the Stata codes on your computer after the repository has been downloaded to your local machine. 
 
 ****
 
Troubleshooting: 
 
* IMPE: Imperial College COVID-19 model/study 
 
* On 20210824, the Imperial College COVID-19 model/study removed their "old fits" – all previously released updates from day 1 up to and including IMPE update 20210719. 

This means the Imperial College COVID-19 model/study is no more a periodically updated study with ACCESSIBLE updates – short of early retirement of the study. 

Several thousand lines of codes that used their previously released updates will not work. 

The remedy for CovidVisualized repositories (https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2 for Iran, https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry for Canada, and https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal for the global level) is to comment out the command line reading csv data from https://github.com/mrc-ide/global-lmic-reports/tree/master/data. 
 
 
* To -comment out-,
 
For https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2,

In files:
 
/Users/username/Downloads/covir2-main/20210806/code/master/do country master.do, _downloaded to your local machine_,

where 20210806 denotes uptake 20210806 in this repository that uses IMPE update 20210719, or earlier uptake here that use earlier updates of IMPE,

in line 130, that currently reads as:

do "$pathcovir2/IMPE/do country IMPE.do" 

double forward slashes // have been put at the beginning of the line, so that it reads as:

// do "$pathcovir2/IMPE/do country IMPE.do" 

save the do file and then run the file.

* However, the previously stored results, such as the graphs stored in 
 
"covir2-main/20210806/output/merge/asterisk.pdf" and 
 
"covir2-main/20210806/output/IMPE/asterisk.pdf" preserve a graphical copy of previously accessed the Imperial College COVID-19 model/study removed updates.

### Logical order of graphs

  
1.	Uptake date: Most recent uptake, followed by less recent uptakes
  
    . To examine changes in predictions across consecutive uptakes
  
2.	Outcomes: Daily deaths, Daily cases or infections, Hospital-related outcomes, Daily deaths estimated to reported, Daily cases or infections estimated to reported cases.
  
    . To examine different outcomes with different public health consequences and model performance implications
  
3.	Calendar time of estimates coverage: All-time, followed by 2021
  
    . To view the whole epidemic trajectory, and further focus on near future
  
4.	Scenarios: Reference scenarios, followed by alternative scenarios
  
    . To examine the main (aka. status quo) scenario, and alternative (better and worse) scenarios
  
5.	Models: Different models within each graph (for which model estimates update release dates are maximally synchronized), plus official reports of the country to WHO (curated by Johns Hopkins university) as under-reported benchmark for trends 
  
    . To examine how heterogeneity in methods used by different models results in heterogenous results for the same outcome (same time-place-person aggregated units)
  
7. Graphs for other outcomes (e.g., Total deaths) are stored individually in [`/merge/`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210704/output/merge) directory https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210704/output/merge, and stored in a single file ["graphs merge 20210704.pdf"](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/20210704/graphs%20merged%2020210704.pdf)   https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/20210704/graphs%20merged%2020210704.pdf (and similar files, e.g., with /[`20210401`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/20210401/graphs%20merged%20uptake%2020210401.pdf)/), where /20210704/ denotes the uptake date. Graphs from individual models are stored in study namesake directories, e.g., [`20210704/output/IHME`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210704/output/IHME)
