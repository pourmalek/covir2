This file "do Iran master.do" was set up to be run from:
 |Users|local-user-name|Downloads|covir2-main|202YMMDD|code|master|do Iran master.do
 where 2021MMDD is the udpate date, e.g. starting with 20210405

If the first run does not go thru due to directory path clash, edit the contents within " " of the line 56 or 59 below, located beneath ****** set path based on local operating system ****** ,,, 
,,, to reflect the location of directory /covir2-main/ or \covir2-main\ on your local machine. Path should be:


global pathcovir2 "/Users/`usrnam'/Downloads/covir2-main/202YMMDD/code/" [for Mac]

global pathcovir2 = "C:\Users\\`usrnam'\Downloads\covir2-main\202YMMDD\code\" [for Windows]



It can be moved to and run from anywhere else as far as path requirements are adjusted. 

This code was developed and run using Stata SE 14.2 on MacOS Big Sur 11.2.2 (also ran on same flavour of Stata on Windows 10).
