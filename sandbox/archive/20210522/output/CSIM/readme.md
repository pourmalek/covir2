## CSIM 20210522 output readme on 20210528


CSIM (COVID SIMULATION) by Imperial College is similar to Oxford model, in both of the user than feed some input data, set or adjust some model specifics, and get the output from such user-customized models. 

[CSIM info in this repo](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/sandbox/CSIM) incudes model specifications (general), as well as pluses and minuses of the CSIM (COVID SIMULATION) model.

Similar to the Oxford model, CSIM website contains some static old default data and specifics for each country. Such default placeholder data were used in a test-run for addiction of CSIM and its integration with the five available models in this repository. 

The default placeholder data and specifics need to be updated and fine-tuned indeed. That being taken into consideration, the default placeholder data and specifics on CSIM web site for Iran are cured here in a test-dose:
