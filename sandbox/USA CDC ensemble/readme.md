Ensemble model

We have one pre-print manuscript that describes the performance of the ensemble forecasts through July 2020, as well as a second pre-print that evaluates the predictive performance of the ensemble and dozens of other models through all of 2020.

Forecast Inclusion and Assumptions

The teams with forecasts included in the ensembles are displayed below. Forecasts are included when they meet a set of submission and data quality requirements, further described here: https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub#ensemble-modelexternal icon.

The forecasts make different assumptions about social distancing measures. Additional individual model details are available here: 

https://github.com/cdcepi/COVID-19-Forecasts/blob/master/COVID-19_Forecast_Model_Descriptions.mdexternal icon. Details on the ensembleâ€™s accuracy in short-term predictions and its usefulness as a real-time tool to help guide policy and planning can be found here: Ensemble Forecasts of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S.external icon

Intervention assumptions fall into multiple categories:

These modeling groups make assumptions about how levels of social distancing will change in the future:
