Variable name structure

Estimates of Daily Deaths, Total Deaths, Daily Cases, and Total Cases from component studies, are the target primary outcomes intended in the review. Incident daily event estimates are targeted for Total Deaths and Total Cases. 

In order to facilitate handling and preparation of the four outcome variables, naming of the variables from component studies was performed following some conventions described below, which will facilitate following the State codes. 

Sample variable name:
TotDeaMeRaA01S00V03
1234567890123456789
         10      

Tot...Dea...Me....Ra.....A01.....S00......V03
1-3...4-6...7-8...9-10...11-13...14-16....17-19

1-3 		Tot or Day: Total (cumulative) or Daily
4-6 		Dea or Cas: Deaths or Cases
7-8 		Me, Lo, or Up: Mean, Lower, Upper (uncertainty bound)
9-10 	Ra or Sam: Raw (not smoothed) or Smoothed
11-13 	A00 to A05: Component study number 
14-16 	S??: Scenario number within component study
17-19	V??: Model version of component study
