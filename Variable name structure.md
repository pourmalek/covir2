### Variable name structure

Estimates of Daily Deaths, Total Deaths, Daily Cases, and Total Cases from component studies, are the target primary outcomes intended in the review. Incident daily event estimates are targeted for Total Deaths and Total Cases. 

In order to facilitate handling and preparation of the four outcome variables, naming of the variables from component studies was performed following some conventions described below. 

Variable names have 7 parts, each part denoting one piece of info about the variable, as described below through an example. 

*
*

#### --- Example variable name:

TotDeaMeRaA01S00V03

1234567890123456789


Tot...Dea...Me....Ra.....A01.....S00......V03

1-3...4-6...7-8...9-10...11-13...14-16....17-19


* 1-3 	Tot or Day: Total (cumulative) or Daily

* 4-6 	Dea or Cas: Deaths or Cases

* 7-8 	Me, Lo, or Up: Mean, Lower, Upper (uncertainty bound)

* 9-10 	Ra or Sm: Raw (not smoothed) or Smoothed

* 11-13 A00 to A05: Component study number (more details below)

* 14-16 S??: Scenario number within component study (more details below)

* 17-19	V??: Version of the model in component study (more details below)


Version of the model in component study is the only part that is fixed within each each component study in this review. 


The sample varaiable name TotDeaMeRaA01S00V03 denotes Total Deaths, mean raw, DELPHI, single scenario, version 3.
