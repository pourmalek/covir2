### Logical order of graphs

1.	Location level: National, followed by 3 select provinces (two most affected, and BC)
  
    . To follow prediction for the national level, and further examine if province-level increases are predicted
  
2.	Uptake date: Most recent uptake, followed by less recent uptakes
  
    . To examine changes in predictions across consecutive uptakes
  
3.	Outcomes: Daily deaths, Daily cases or infections, Hospital-related outcomes, Daily deaths estimated to reported, Daily cases or infections estimated to reported cases.
  
    . To examine different outcomes with different public health consequences and model performance implications
  
4.	Calendar time of estimates coverage: All-time, followed by 2021
  
    . To view the whole epidemic trajectory, and further focus on near future
  
5.	Scenarios: Reference scenarios, followed by alternative scenarios
  
    . To examine the main (aka. status quo) scenario, and alternative (better and worse) scenarios
  
6.	Models: Different models within each graph (for which model estimates update release dates are maximally synchronized), plus official reports of the country to WHO (curated by Johns Hopkins university) as under-reported benchmark for trends 
  
    . To examine how heterogeneity in methods used by different models results in heterogenous results for the same outcome (same time-place-person aggregated units)
  
7. Graphs for other outcomes (e.g., Total deaths) are stored individually in [`/merge/`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210704/output/merge) directory https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210704/output/merge, and stored in a single file ["graphs merge 20210704.pdf"](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/20210704/graphs%20merged%2020210704.pdf)   https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/20210704/graphs%20merged%2020210704.pdf (and similar files, e.g., with /[`20210401`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/20210401/graphs%20merged%20uptake%2020210401.pdf)/), where /20210704/ denotes the uptake date. Graphs from individual models are stored in study namesake directories, e.g., [`20210704/output/IHME`](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/tree/main/20210704/output/IHME)
