# Troubleshooting


Once you have started executing the downloaded code, in your local |Downloads|covir2-main|Data|master|do Iran merge.do, Stata may return *ERRORs*, or may *RESTART*. The following are among possible causes and treatments. The downloaded "do Iran master.do" is expected to be located in in your computerâ€™s local directory Downloads |Downloads|covir2-main|Data|master|, with | being \ or / depending on the operating system. 
<br/><br/>
* **Problem** (1): If the *ERROR* message is about file path or directory clash, e.g., the error message reads as, unable to change to (some directory name), 

* **Treatment**: Make sure the file path to directory |Data| is: 

"/Users/your-user-name/Downloads/covir2-main/Data/" [for Mac]

"C:\Users\your-user-name\Downloads\covir2-main\Data\\" [for Windows].

Manually rearrange the directories so that the expected file path leading to |Data| reads as mentioned above. 
*
Sometime, if the downloaded zip file is unzipped manually (in Windows), there might be a possibility that the file path is not as identical to the correct path that is created after auto-inflation of the zip file and shown above. In any case, rearrange the directories so that the expected file path mentioned above leads to |Data| (in root of which is located the "do Iran master.do").
<br/><br/>
There might be an additional potential for file directory and path clash in "do Iran IHME.do" in case clash occurs in the beginning (in "do Iran master.do"), and the treatment is likewise manual editing of the file paths.  
<br/><br/>

* **Problem** (2): Stata spontaneously *RESTARTs* with a clear start logo. 

If during running the codes, the demand and supply of memory needed and available for Stata get critically unbalanced, it might be possible that Stata restarts by itself without warning and shows a fresh start logo and empty memory. 
- **Treatment**: Provide more memory available for Stata:
- In older versions of Stata, manually set a higher memory, e.g., - set mem 1000m-. Memory no longer needs to be set in modern Statas; memory adjustments are performed on the fly automatically.
- Quit all other open and / or applications / programs until Stata runs the codes and the last output, that is "log Iran merge.smcl" is shown up.
