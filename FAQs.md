* Question: Are these codes in `R (CRAN)` software?

* Answer: No. 

These codes are not in R. They are in `Stata`. Notes files are stored in markdown files with (.md) extension. If no application that specifically reads markdown files (.md) is working on a local machine, the operating system might open or suggest opening markdown files with R or R Studio. While R is not very successful in reading these .md files, R Studio reads them is their raw format.
