### Study update dates in uptake 20210819

DELP 20210819, **_IHME 20210819_**, IMPE 20210806, LANL 20210815, SRIV 20210819

IHME update:

20210820: IHME update 20210819 released on 20210820. "This page was last updated at 5:30 p.m. Pacific, August 20, 2021." IHME update 20210819 released on 20210820 creates directory 2021_08_04 when downloaded (as of 20210820 2053 PST), the same thing that IHME update 20210806 does. Predictions and files of IHME update 20210819 are (still) identical with IHME update 20210806. Since IHME update 20210702, it takes a few stages for IHME update to be fully delivered. The herald is change of "date" ("This page was last updated ...") and curves in https://covid19.healthdata.org/global. Then would come the release of an update with a new update date (and files) in http://www.healthdata.org/covid/data-downloads, but the files (and predictions) are still identical with files (and predictions) with the latest previous fully delivered update. 

20210823: Expectedly, IHME replaced their IHME update 20210819 released on 20210820 with a genuinely new file that does not create the old directory 2021_08_04 when downloaded. That is the final stage of release of IHME update 20210819, unless the file might be removed or become not accessible, the risk highest being during the next seven days. 


IMPE update: 

This update 20210806 of IMPE is dead at birth FOR IRAN. See graph for Iran here: [(5) Daily deaths, 2021, reference scenario with uncertainty, IMPE](https://github.com/pourmalek/covir2/blob/main/20210819/output/merge/graph%2016%20COVID-19%20daily%20deaths%2C%20Iran%2C%20reference%20scenario%20with%20uncertainty%2C%20IMPE.pdf). While JOHN and Worldometer web site show PCR-positive daily deaths officially report by Ministry of Health of Iran surpassed 411 on 20210802, the IMPE update 20210806 released on 20210813 says daily deaths will soon go below 400 in Iran. Does the above observation increase the validity of this update 20210806 of IMPE in other locations or at the global level? No.
