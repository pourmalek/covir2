DELP 20210819, **_IHME 20210819_**, IMPE 20210806, LANL 20210815, SRIV 20210819

20210820: IHME update 20210819 released on 20210820. "This page was last updated at 5:30 p.m. Pacific, August 20, 2021." IHME update 20210819 released on 20210820 creates directory 2021_08_04 when downloaded (as of 20210820 2053 PST), the same thing that IHME update 20210806 does. Predictions and files of IHME update 20210819 are (still) identical with IHME update 20210806. 

Since IHME update 20210702, it takes a few stages for IHME update to be fully delivered. The herald is change of "date" ("This page was last updated ...") and curves in https://covid19.healthdata.org/global. Then would come the release of an update with a new update date (and files) in http://www.healthdata.org/covid/data-downloads, but the files (and predictions) are still identical with files (and predictions) with the latest previous fully delivered update.
